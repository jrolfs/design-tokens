    I'd like to see how we would use this in react - perhaps a toy project / subdirectory or a PR in ot-react-ui or something
    I think we wouldn't want to send these XML strings as CSS modules but rather as commonJS if I understand the react implementation strategy you have in mind?
    if that's true, perhaps we still output CSS as CSS classes or CSS module values data-uri-encoded so it's easy to use for "other hosters" - but I think react is the only thing we truly need to support so maybe we can cut this?
